<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About The Project

The "Birthday" application was created so that the user does not forget when to celebrate a birthday. 
A counter is used that shows how many days are left until your birthday, and when that day arrives, the song "Happy Birthday to You" is played.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
